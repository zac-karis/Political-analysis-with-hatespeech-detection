Emmanuel Wesang'ula,We should  not be talking  about impeachment  without  talking  about  treason  that Raila Committed  after 2017 election.  Raila wanted to overthrow  the Jubilee  government  yet he hasn't  come out  and apologise to Kenyans. Infact  Uhuru should  be talking  on this.
Kiprono Kirui,"The most stupid and annoying thing is that the same people who elected Uhuruto three times are the same people who are shouting loudest about failures of Jubilee government. But even more bizarre is that the same group are the ones who are pushing for Ruto’s election after 10 years of failure of Uhuruto. Please give other Kenyans a chance to also choose a president, the country does not belong to only two communities who for 62 years have contributed to the country’s failures."
Sammie Mutharimi,"Ruto is a politician who can tell lies in broad daylight without blinking, he can say something and he changes it the next minute to bring confusion successfully, ruto is a power-hungry man who can use any means to clinch it"
Steve Mbugua,Of course he is the one...we all saw him taking un oath in uhurupark 1982 he was the organizer of a coup that wanted to overthrow the late president moi..he is a power hungry man who will do anything to clinch into power.
RONOH,Deputy President William Ruto has promised to convert the Higher Educations Loans Board (Helb) from a loan to a grant if he wins the presidency in the August elections.
Trojans War,Why would Raila impeach the president and  he knows very well that it is Ruto who is going to take over. Ruto knows too well that his followers are so numb that they will accept anything he says.
Nickson Ekume,Good reason why i should vote him lot of wisdom in him. This is now leadership you dont engage yourself in any talk in the market even if they try to drag you in just try your level best to avoid and mind your own business thats show level of maturity. Im very sure Raila is fully aware what happened but he is the kind of person who knows how to zip. After Ruto was caught pants down he decided to drag Baba's name in to settle the score but baba has escaped the drag net
Jossy Gatho,Uhurus puppet has disowned him..those cheap politics Uhuru is trying to do will cost him dearly.. HE DR WILLIAM RUTO will be the fifth president of Kenya who will by Gods grace will get a historical win..
Moindi Mi Gi Raw,"Well if Ruto was aware about Raila's plot to impeach UHURU,why didn't he divulge that vital information? What stopped him from telling the President?"
Wanjau Jesse,"The president told the elders that it's Raila who saved him from being impeached. I don't know why the president is acting this desparate. If he is so desparate because he loves this country, then he should not have allowed people to suffer the way they have suffered. Clearly there is a hidden agenda which we must resist."
Mutisya Kalundu,We heard Raila loud and clear. Don’t alter his words. He was very clear than no one ever attempted to impeach Uhuru
Ayanga Peter,This is how intelligence works. I know my friens from that corrupt movement were expecting Baba to negatively mention Ruto's name. Raila is very wise and intelligent.
Francis Makokha,"Of course, it has nothing to do with RAO, the most convenient scapegoat in Kenya's political landscape for years. Let Ruto now explain who it was. There appears to be something much deeper than a mere impeachment, that's why some people are squirming in their seats and scratching their heads seeking a scapegoat. Before the elections, an earthquake of a revelation shall emerge and be confirmed. Sorry, the intelligence around the President doesn't sleep. That's what kept Moi in power for all the years and every regime for that matter."
Justin Kipkoech,I was not aware of any impeachment attempts on Uhuru therefore will not comment on it. Let Ruto carry his own cross —Raila Odinga  Own goal 🤣😂😂😅😅  #2022election #KenyaKwanza #kenyantrends
Edward I. Gachogu,"When Raila was in opposition,  it was actually his duty to keep the gvt of the day on its toes, including threatening to impeach the president; so that wud not be news at all.  But it's known, even b4 Uhuru pronounced it, that Ruto was trying to combine Jubilee MPs who were loyal to him, with those of Raila , to impeach the president, after 2017 reelection. That's evident from the Karen breakfast visits b4 every cabinet meetings called by the President."
Siss Patty,You two ought to face each other and finish your endless blames. We even don't know which ones are real versus lies. You can do better politics other than blaming each other
Charles Geytosh,It's better we could have elected raila than uhuru. It's only we never knew his tomorrow
Fredrick Aginga,Emmanuel let me remind that RAILA is very wise politician....he swore in as  PEOPLES president !!!! Note that. So don't talk about TREASON....unless u don't know it's meaning
Kairu Zack Wakairu,Raila is just reminding Mugathe to pull up his weight and deliver Mt Kenya as he promised..time is of essence
Papah Dickson Babuu,"Uhuru: Ruto wanted to work with Raila to impeach me,but Raila declined. Raila:I don't of any attempts or claims of overthrowing the jubilee govt."
Alex Baraza,Follow news daily guys you will come to terms that NTV is just okay.....Ruto denied those claims made by uhuru and instead accused Odinga of being the orchestrater of the same...so Odinga is denying accusations made by dp linking him to to it
Oscar Carzola Gunner,"If Uhuru wud av been impeached, who wud av benefited if not Ruto himself🤔 so he shud not deceive us that it was Raila yet we Kno Ruto was even the one behind,  ""we shall revisit statement"" since he was the mastermind of the presidents tough headedness after election"
Kibii Bartoo Alfred,I weep when highly respected media turns to propaganda!
Divinah Jason,When will be ta voting  date..aki I'm fade up following  Kenyan politics.
Dennis Tonui,"Pres.Uhuru noted the rising fame of Ruto when the honeymoon was still hot.Ruto planned and executed several successful projects.Fearing for his deteriorating fame, the President decided to join hands with Rudderless Odinga to maintain his royal status.Given opportunity, Ruto can create a self-reliant country free from debts."
Bob Rono,Interesting. They want to rely on hearsay that someone was plotting to impeach him but they don't want to mention the one who swore himself in with an aim of overthrowing him! I reckon Kenyans with improved education have surpassed this crap.
Favoured Chris,He will even deny that he voted against him 4times.....We know he even tried to overthrow the legitimate government of President Uhuru by swearing himself in
Steve Muriithi,"Whoever who could have impeached him, would have done a very commendable job. Surely, surely, why didn't it succeed??"
Frank Ke,The other day uhuru called a meeting with mount kenya leaders only to realise 6 of them were to attend that meeting in statehouse. This statement had already spread in public domain and everybody was aware about that meet. The following day uhuru annouced that there was no meeting he had plan. This man there is something bothering him he is not himself he needs an emergency check up pliz🙏

Paul Githaka,"Let these people tell us clearly what they disagreed upon and stop beating about the bush ,and most likely money and now one is feeling shy to hit the nail on the head"
Mai Cousin,He said it's Raila who saved him from the plotted impeachment by Ruto.   Raila the saviour nae anasema he is not aware ....... 🙆🏼‍♀️ Imagine hiyo aibu yote ?? From the head of state to the head Furofaganda 🙆🏼‍♀️🙆🏼‍♀️ from the symbol of unity to symbol of division !! Sad Maliza ukwende!!!
