Mulei Ule Msee,What will happen to kidero
Daniel David,If only God could hear my prayer then Magwanga should be Homabay Governor deputize by Wanga.
Ngiroh Christopher Kipsang,Then you will hear him pointing fingers at Rutto and telling us how Raila Will win yet he cannot strategize his own winning.
Humfred Kabasa Junior,"The so called ODM is doing more harm than good to the people of Homabay. We are still healing from the pathetic leadership of Awiti and now they are introducing another virus to Homabay county. To hell with ODM, you won't see my vote."
Den Nish,"Chinua Achebe says "" a goat is not left to suffer alone because of labour when there is an old man around"" ARROW OF GOD"
Philip Chianda Ja Nyamware,"Those that are belittling Wanga..that lady is a go getter...whatever she sets her eyes on she will use all the available resources and connection to get it..She is the next big thing in National politcs,Wanga will even be elected as the first woman to chair the council of governors should she clinch the HB seat..."
Richard Njuguna,"You mean Mr chairman you can't make it to gubernatorial, and the way you used to defend your party on national televisions"
Fred Okeke,"The decision and selection will be made in Karen , Homabayians have no say in this race , let's just vote and go home then wait for the appointment. Voting is a legal must process , let's just focus on president and MCAs elections, the rest of the seats Karen moguls  will take care of and u will do NOTHING about it am sorry."
Vitz Cherui,Kidero might not be the popular candidate among the contestants but will clinch the seat due his heavy pockets and close association with Baba.
Omiti Otieno,"As homabain from Kasipul constituency, I'm going to mobiliz my boys to vote in William Ruto....... HON JOSEPH OYUGI MAGWANGA, has been betrayed by the orange party boss twice...... Because magwanga will not be on the ballot..... I'll not waste my time going to vote for Raila..... Let his puppet(Gladys Wanga) whom he value so much vote for him.... On behalf of 890k voters of homabay..... Very soon we are going to invite Dp William Ruto in Homabay...... Discuss way forward on how we are going to vote him in as homabay constituents"
Crispin Nyakweba,"As a resident of Homabay Asumbi, we would rather have Oyugi Magwanga as the governor. However Odm is held captive, when l saw Sk with Genowa, l knew that is a direct ticket. Consider that with Mama l closeness with Wanga. It is done. ODM always messes up when the price is so close"
Nyakwar Jabunde,"This woman will never be homabay gavana, she WILL NEVER be whether she is given ticket by Odinga dictatorial movement"
Victor Onyango,"Wanga is always leading on social media but as they say, kwa ground she is very unpopular with the voters"
Nick Ocham,I would be pleased to see the first female Luo Governor.
Omiti Otieno,"That's the reason why I'll not participate in general election.... We've been denied opportunity to nominate governor of our choice...... It's either, I'll vote Ruto or abstain from voting, it will depend on my moodz"
Aimo Alpha,"There are stronger candidates than Mbadi therefore what you're saying here holds no water. The likes of Kidero, Magwanga and Isaiah"
Adhudhu Leah,From a distance Mbadi saw him self loosing the race
Don Owino Jr.,"James Orengo and Oburu Oginga should follow suit too. For the sake of peace, development & posterity."
Oketch Samson,"Mbadi was going no where, same to wanga"
Ngare Romans,We are tired  with  Odingasm in Luo Nyanza. Raila we are going  to teach you a lesson  you will never forget
Julius Agiro,How is it a boost?We want a fair nominations!

Cheruiyot Kenyalito Kosgey,He realised that he wasn't going get adirect ticket
Jacob Odhiambo,This man Mbadi has no greed for power..it's not an easy thing to do since he dropped to support Mama..so Luo-hearted.
Johnson Kimutai,"Mbadi knew he was going nowhere, even his village pipo couldn't have voted him"
Justin Onyancha,Kidero should seek the seat in Nairobi

Peter Shisia,Negotiated democracy.......ni upuzi
Jsunda Senior,Magwanga is in the race too
Marvin Omondi,"Kama unajua you are not a,voter in Homabay don't misslead the candidates on Social Media"
Simon Mucheke Waweru,"Mbadi did not drop his bid, he was ordered to withdraw."
Robikip Robinson,Angenyoroshwa nyoronyoro. The woman's record is incomparable to that noisemaker's trackless record
Empress Dachez,Very good coz no one was going to elect him # genowa
Akumu Brian Akumu,Voter apathy loading. If Homabay County residents can't vote a leader of their choice to kare presidency no be obedi....
