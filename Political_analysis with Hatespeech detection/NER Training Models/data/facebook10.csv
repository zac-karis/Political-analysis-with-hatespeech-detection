Mzalendo Mzalendo,"Ruto holds political meetings in his official residence in Karen, which is a GoK building, but he is advicing Uhuru to stop holding political meetings in Statehouse. Both Uhuru and Ruto held political meetings in Statehouse in the 2013 and 2017 campaigns"

Kennedy Njuguna,When ruto meets gema in karen it's promoting unity but when uhuru does the same in state house it's disunity.Ruto should concede he has lost the battle and wait 2042 after kalonzo
Patriotizer Ogian,"Uhuru will regret burning this country, as a man enough,he should retire peacefully and leave kenyans to decide for themselves on who to elect, We citizens should be very watchful, these greedy politicians will make us turn against each other for their own good, we destroyed our past and we are busy destroying our future under the the influence of these inhumane politicians,.......let stand together..... brotherhood and sisterhood is what will make our country change"

Ray Eric's,He should even tell Uhuru to stop sending bad signals on tribalsm and let people decide on which person to vote in
Kim Wajoseph,Surely. Would Ruto if elected  wish to have a  deputy  who gives him orders. Greed for power is what as destroyed  Ruto.hes the worst V.p kenya have.. He's now giving  orders to his boss. History  will judge me if Ruto becomes president with such behaviour
