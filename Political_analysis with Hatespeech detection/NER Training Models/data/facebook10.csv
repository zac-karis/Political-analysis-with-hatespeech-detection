Mzalendo Mzalendo,"Ruto holds political meetings in his official residence in Karen, which is a GoK building, but he is advicing Uhuru to stop holding political meetings in Statehouse. Both Uhuru and Ruto held political meetings in Statehouse in the 2013 and 2017 campaigns"

Jane Wambui,"Uhuru fears Raila's hooliganism,he has told us severally to elect Raila for the sake of peace.The criminal justice should be used against Raila should he preach peace.We are electing Ruto on merit and his ability to deliver good governance"
Oundo Stephen,"Our dear Heavenly Father,may you grant us in August with leaders who will work together for the betterment of this country.Leaders who will understand our plight and endeavor to lessen our tribulations.Leaders who will not be at loggerheads with each other.Amen."
Peculiar Cate,"But UK hinted at this long ago at Bomas when he said, in WSR's presence, that he and his deputy were running a relay race, and instead of WSR waiting in line, he ran back to get the baton!"
Kennedy Njuguna,When ruto meets gema in karen it's promoting unity but when uhuru does the same in state house it's disunity.Ruto should concede he has lost the battle and wait 2042 after kalonzo
Patriotizer Ogian,"Uhuru will regret burning this country, as a man enough,he should retire peacefully and leave kenyans to decide for themselves on who to elect, We citizens should be very watchful, these greedy politicians will make us turn against each other for their own good, we destroyed our past and we are busy destroying our future under the the influence of these inhumane politicians,.......let stand together..... brotherhood and sisterhood is what will make our country change"

Ray Eric's,He should even tell Uhuru to stop sending bad signals on tribalsm and let people decide on which person to vote in
Kim Wajoseph,Surely. Would Ruto if elected  wish to have a  deputy  who gives him orders. Greed for power is what as destroyed  Ruto.hes the worst V.p kenya have.. He's now giving  orders to his boss. History  will judge me if Ruto becomes president with such behaviour
