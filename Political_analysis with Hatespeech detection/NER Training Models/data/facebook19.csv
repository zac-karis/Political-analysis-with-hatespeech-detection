Saga Max,"The constitution is very clear...who will take over/Benefit when the president is impeached. Ruto waited for the president to talk about it......so he can now say it's Raila... At least he has confirmed there was an impeachment plan,but he kept quiet. That makes him an accomplice!! He has just set himself in a trap!!"
Philemon Liech,Ruto can say anything now that his ill plans have been exposed.. He is too dangerous to rule this county if he can do that to his boss.. Patience pays...
Trojans War,At least you have confirmed to us that someone wanted to impeach the president only that it is coming Abit late when we have already believed The president and livondo. But  what did Raila stand to gain knowing fully well that you were to be the president once uhuru was impeached? You must be lieng to us mr.
Carole Otieno,Master of lies ....after raila impeached Uhuru who will benefit...... So you think we are fool's ..
Arap Meli,"Where has Ruto said that it was Raila who wanted to impeach Uhuru?  Ruto is alleged to have wanted to impeach Uhuru so that he becomes President.  Ruto says Raila tried to overthrow the government in 82 and swore himself President, so he's the one with the motive."
Gumba Bruce,"If so that would have happened in 2013-17,but my question is how?? Yet the tyranny of  numbers could allow him to do that. Jubilee nominations in 2017 that he was fully incharge  had impeachment in plan."
Aloo Denish,"Mr. Ruto, your case was more dangerous than that of Raila who was openly an opponent to President Uhuru. Yours is a case of one of the king's adviser/official plotting to eliminate the king from within; more lethal than on open enemy. Actually, Raila would benefit nothing by impeaching Uhuru, it's you who would still take over in such a scenario"
Erick Moturi,Mr Promises is a dangerous kalenjinga. Can do anything to ascend to power. Why? To protect his evil doings.  Most kenyans are awake. He has already confused and destroyed the church.
Yotam Malibe,"So Raila had such plans, Ruto knew about them and did nothing. Maybe action favoured his raw political ambitions if it's true."
Ochieng Owaga,"Raila could not impeach Uhuru so that you benefit...we're not fools,"
Andrew Wekesa,Kumbe ni Ukweli! But who would have constitutionally benefited from Uhuru's impeachment?
Samuel M. Ikiara,"WSR had no reason to impeach Uhuru,  Uhuru impeached himself from our hearts by associating with those he told us were enemies, we don't trust him anymore.  WSR has remained the same and that's why we will support him.  Uhuru should stop embarrassing himself,  nobody can believe his utterances that don't make sense"
Jeremy Okach,AND AS HIS PRINCIPAL ASSISTANT YOU DIDN'T INFORM HIM THAT RAILA WAS PLANNING TO IMPEACH HIM?
Escritt Senna,"üòÇ Uhuru could not support Raila if not of the hurtful betrayal from you Mr.Ruto, Uhuru always knew Raila plans, but your plans on Uhuru were more bizarre that's why he chose Raila. Better the enemy you know than the ones you don't know (back bitters)"
Frank Kaburu,If Roto wanted to impeach Uhuru he could overthrow him the time he left government to Roto and went ICC
Odhiambo Kassim Mukudi,this is a confirmation that Uhuru is right.Ruto had ill plans.
Jane Nganga,"We don't care who wanted to peanch who""Ruto all the way"""
Benardito Ule Msanii,This impeachment of uhuru Kenyatta was of benefit I don't know why we have to talk about it  pple are suffering because of him if it wasn't successful then lucky of him he should thank God for he lasted ten years let him go home peacefuly
Arap Chesulut,"The guilty are afraid. Ruto agrees there was an impeachment plan, but says it's Raila who planned it. Question. Who would have benifited more if it had succeeded, Ruto or Raila. If it's Raila who planned the impeachment, why did Ruto oppose the handshake, urged Uhuru to maintain a hard-line on Raila? Is Rutos uncontrollable anger and bitterness, good for the country?"
Dundo Said,Raila its understood he even took an oath pretending to be peoples president but could he have gotten support from kalonzo and musalia ange overthrow kweli
Joseph Cheruiyot,"So it's undeniable fact that there was impeachment all the same. The president is right and the issue here is, who wanted to impeach the president and for what reason. Further, who were going to be the beneficiaries of this agenda"
Seth Senior,Kenyans never knew that Uhuru was to be impeached
Kod Wa Yurop,"One thing this Sugoi man should know Kenyans are not fools but only some few followers he has,even if Raila could have manage to impeach Uhuru constitutionally Ruto automatically becomes the president so on what benefit could baba have benefited by doing so.we are not fools"
Ashley Naliakah,God may you bless Ruto and fight for him Amen!!
Miriam Kemunto,So there was an impeachment plan üò≥ received this news with alot of shock sisemi kitu but I will never be brainwashed.The truth will always prevail
Esau Ogutu,"Among  the options Raila had, impeachment was not one of them because impeachment involves numbers in parliament and the Senate which at the time Raila didn't have. His options were either secession (separating themselves from the government and having their own government) 2. Overthrowing the government (making the president to leave office by force through the army or the people). But because he considered the country important than himself he shelved the two options."
Musila Musyoka,He should tell us what caused the fall out if Uhuru is not talking the truth
Zablon Oboyio,So the impeachment story is True!  Now I know even the Kuibia / kuimbia uhuru kura story is true
Gordon Odhiambo,"How would Raila do that when Uhuruto always bragged a bout their tyranny of numbers. The truth is that the DP had pulled majority of the legislators on his side and imagined they could even impeach Uhuru if they wanted. We haven't forgotten the ""bring in baby"" by Alice Wahome during BBI"
Carol Jes,Confusion remains at Uhuru Kenyatta samoe ruto remains the wise
Benhard Nicho,"For what? Then you become the President? ...how is it possible, Raila to impeach the President then Ruto becomes the president! Haah no! Not possible."
Hempstone Smith Arum,And who could have benefited on impeachment and why did he not tell uhuru since they were good and close friends
Willyheight Saisi,"Very true after all that raila went through,However, How did you get to known about the plan?We're you in conspiracy with raila?Did you do anything as a Dp and inform your friend the President? Three who was to benefit after the execution of the plan?Raila the opposition leader or Dp the second in command? You can fool some people sometimes but you can't fool all the people all the times,Something is not adding up"

Kojoa ulale bro, perepere itakumaliza, please focus on your agendas for you to go far but this unfortunate vibes with your boss destroys you more than Uhuru.
