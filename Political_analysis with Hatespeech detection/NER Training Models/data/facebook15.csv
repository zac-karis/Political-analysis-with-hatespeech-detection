Mac Prince Otani,The ex who has refused to move on.
Sky T Karish,"Uhuru are those wives who calls for a divorce , when it succeeds they sue you over negligence and child support.  Ruto dunia uza Jesu even after feeding them."
Mzalendo Mzalendo,"Dear William Ruto, Supporting Uhuru Kenyatta unconditionally when you pocketed 7billion, a deputy President position, and half of the government? Stop taking Kenyans for fools. Raundi hii hakuna wajinga wengi Kenya.üò≥"
IV Sheikh Anwar,"The truth is in 2012  Ruto needed uhuru more than Uhuru needs him. Uhuru helped him at the ICC with the kenyatta family connections. Uhuru gave him his British lawyers after Ruto struggled there with his local lawyers. If you didn't stood with him, he could have team up with others, in 2012 Uhuru had money and Mt Kenya votes."
Wamboi Wambo,"Very true but don't worry malipo ni hapahapa duniani,be strong we will vote  you, Ruto all the way and we love you no matter what vigeugeu are saying"

Musir Juma,"Wacha kulialia mwanaume. Politics is dynamic. Eve Saitoti was told by Moi ""URAFIKI NA UONGOZI NI VITU TOFAUTI"" Any president would wish to leave his country to a responsible, capable and safe hands which yours are not. Pole. Surgoi beckons."
Joyce Goga,"True even Raila supported Kibaki to be president of Kenya but Kibaki never supported him back  ,its normal in politics just try and address the issue of president assassination"
Cynthia Daisy,"This is the kind of opposition we as country will be having full of cry babies, very weak indeed I think Ruto said uhuru has only one vote which doesn't not add anything to UDA because he has numbers,what has happened"
Julius Katutu,"I think you have been in this country long enough to know that we run politics of betrayal, convenience and self-interest. I propose you ignore and move on, the finish line is so close that you can only focus on the ultimate."
Davie Doh,The DP should stop blaming the president for supporting another person. He should otherwise prove to Kenyans that he can do it alone without the president. If he was a major factor in 2013/17 victories then why not now? Sense of defeats have started showing up.
Kennedy Njuguna,"If it's about paying debt let's start with the one of jaramogi in 1961 then we come to raila of 2002 where he assisted kibaki,then 2007 for kalonzo standing with kibaki and the now we come to ruto....let's be sincere to our debts so that other communities can trust us the Mt kenya"
Mathiew Michiemo,"This guy keeps talking of the past,nilisaidia Uhuru blabla,nilisaidia   Raila blabla as he,s the only leader who has undergone betrayal.Rao said kibaki Tosha without conditions and the price he has paid up to date is Betrayal,simply accept and move on,otherwise u r becoming a bad example to our upcoming kids"
Erickoh Mc Osidha Junior,And you got half of the government. Arap Mashamba must tell his supporters the whole truth
Taa Andy,"So what now, we voted for the two of you then though you caused us a lot of pain, we opted to learn our mistakes silently. We have not flooded the media with regrets. We choose to be quiet because in quietness you are considered wise. So you can emulate us also and it will be fine.üôÜüôÜüôÜüôÜüôÜ"
Edwin Mwema,Imagine ruto u stood by him when all those he has now were against him!take heart ruto we are very much with u !u r the next president !uhuru kumi ruto kumi
Kariuki Welding,Boss accept and move on..we are tired of your repeating topics... don't you have any ather agenda to convince Kenyan... Uhuru already move on..
Erick Moturi,"My friend stand with people in Baringo. They're dying of malnutrition, hunger and curable diseases like malaria.  Give them money, since you want them poor. You told them to plant avocado yet you import maize.   Then give them wheelbarrow, it doesn't consume much oil.   Don't lecture Uhuru."
David Gakure,"He didn't help Uhuru, he fought to be in the government!"
Erick Mcmig,"He was paid for his support,   ICC catered for,  given half government which he used to loot when those friends were not there.  His support was not genuine,  used it to ascend to power and loot."
Selah Ondiko,"You stood by him but then you failed in your duties and also turned against him. He was light to carry, you are too heavy."

Ronald Rg,"No doubt Dr.Ruto is a sharp brain.A Brilliant one.But should change his strategy.Should focus more on selling his ideas and not blaming Uhuru,,makes him a cry baby.Focus on gaining votes and not crying about who does not support him.Solidify his ground and stop this thing of Uhuru this ,Uhuru that.,,,tafuta kura Daktari."
Frankline Mwebi,"But you also abandoned him for your greediness for early campaigns, and you also said ur without Uhuru's support, uav realized his importance now, when you could not listen any, when he told you to go slow on campaigns and concentrate on development , you left him four years ago ,drawing salary for no work done !"
Dan Classic,You did that for your personal gains and interests. Your standing besides him had nothing to do with the welfare of this nation. In other words you stood for yourself so better keep it between yourselves.
Noble P Migiro,Campaign my friend don't be mentionening someone is now and then call him and tell him true the phn so ur telling the kenyan so that they can fight or what.....you politics all what you thinks is ur only stomach......do you know life of common mwana inch now is in a very badly way....ndio maana wanajaa kwa mikutano thinking they will have something at the end of ur meeting....wakenya still patiwa ukora...tuuu
Man Lukumbu de Farmer,The cries of this politician reminds me of one of my ex- gal friends . It was so hard for her to believe that the contract had expired and expired forever.  Mr politician please üôè learn to forget and move on ü§£ü§£ü§£ü§£
John Onyuma,"Do you think Kenyans are fools,when you joined together in 2013 making jubilee Government,what did you do,you brought ONLY kalenjins in Government positions...Uhuru choosed at least the face of kenya on his side...you think we dint see you,Now its your time to cry.Kenyans are not fools bwana...we cant trust you with our beloved kenya."
Wich Jawil,My friend what I have learned is that in politics there are no enemies and friends. Remember how Mudavadi and Wetangula were insulted you together with Uhuru. I never knew that they would have come on your side. Mandago said usiweke siasa kwa roho weka kwa lung
Thadeus Peace,"That's not enough to guarantee you support.. How did you behave afterwards. If you had worked with him, despite the opposition invasion of government, which you are crying foul, you would be enjoying support from all Kenyans"
Kioge Seline,This is how jilted lovers remind their boyfriends who have dumped them to  see if they can find a soft spot in their heart to love them again. Ruto is surely very desperate but I can only wish that he concentrates on his agenda instead of fighting for what will never happen. The divorce is sealed and he may find that he's fighting against himself. He must stop crying bitterly and exhibiting scaring  body language
Odero Atieno,"Ruto is going through alot after his evil deed been exposed by the person whom  acted as his boss/ confidante. It's nightmare, that pain cuts deep, atleast when he tells it out, i'm sure he gets some relief."
Edwin Ajuoga,"Raila stood by Kibaki when he was hospitalized,and he gave you power in 2013.So stop crying Baby kijana."
Eunice J. Kyalo,"But it's the truth in this life do not place people too close, tomorrow they will turn against you like you never existed ..... #TheStrongestManIsHeWhoStandsAlone... ~Dr. Stockman..üôè"
Evance Opiyo,Even Uhuru stood by you and his not going around the country singing that bogus song.We are tired of the same song since 2017..
Calvin Ochola,"Kwani ""I help you has become your agenda""never the less life must continue bro"

Nassizu Murume,Ambia wetangula na mudavadi Hivyo
Favoured Cate,"Huyu atalia mpaka lini,he should be encouraging people to cut more trees in Sugoi to avoid his suicidal death coming August 9 2022,it will be bottom down Mr bitterness."
Paul Mwangi,Ruto sounds like a teenager when saying those words. Words of inexperience and desperation
Willy Fred Abu,"But deep in heart you know how much Uhuru helped you plus paying you billions to support him in 2013. Ruto why can't you just be honest and move on, in 2016 Kabogo said that gema community has no any debt with you. The same Kabogo who is pretending to support you."
Junior Masiwa,"It seems you're new in Politics, those whom you're containing now last election they were calling you ""Thief so elewa Siaza"
Baba Precious,In our church good deeds are paid with same goodness
Kelvian Pro,"Very true,and why I will vote for him,I love how he's humble"
Kanake Baibulu,Then you would have stood there for yourself.Unalalamikia nini Si ufanyavyo ufanyalo ukikasirika.You can't tell us alwaythat you were so important than Uhuru then.Uhuru helped so much.
Irungu Nyoike,True & the truth should be told
Gabi Oti,These sentiments are similar to that of a jilted lover. Ruto should tell us how he will improve Kenyan's lives once he become president. We are not interested in their fallout with his boss.
Loise Mwangi,You should forever be greatful to uhuru for everything he has done for you but ulimkosea sana kwa kuharibu nominations and you made sure you eliminated all strong leaders from the mountain but your days are numbered usijione mjanja sana
Arap Giteru,"Dr ruto ought not to worry, voters  knows what they are undergoing in the name of Russia/ukraine war. We shall correct the mess on August ."

Akala Danny,"Look at this political orphan, he said he made Raila Prime Minister and he made Uhuru president. but guess what he cant make himself who ever he wants üòÇüòÇ. Mr Ruto if you own mt Kenya then leave alone uhuru and prove yourself."
Jayalo Vincent,"Hii kura moja ya Uhuru pia imekuuma bradhe! We pray for you though. If God transformed Nebuchadnezer, He can transform Uhunye to support you. Ubuntu"
Michael Njuguna,"The presidency is not about friendship, its about putting the intrests of the country first and not the intrests of a friend.  #Uhuru can support #Raila and still remain your friend. In short, #Uhuru says that, while you have been his friend he has realised that you are not the right person to lead kenya"
Okoth George Omondi,"If we want to condole with and console Ruto, the best way is to convince Uhuru to submit his voting documents to Ruto. With that, Ruto will be convinced that Uhuru isn't going to vote for anyone. Besides he's lamenting of standing with Uhuru, so it's personal, why come to public mourning like a bride mourning the death of the groom minutes before the wedding?"
Bera Robin,In stead of all your speeches being about one person why dont you just win hearts than winning sympathies

Mark John Kiyaka,"You know what happened to Raila after he said ""Kibaki Tosha"" He did not whine about it but picked the pieces and went ahead and beat Kibaki only for the victory to be stollen.  But he is going on with his life.  My point.  Just Man up"
Teridian Dol,"He is behaving like a narssist. This people, he wants us to believe he did  a favour  to uhunye yet he also benefited from being the deputy."
Vincent Mwangi,"You're all the way up. Focus on yoursel, Uhuru is past and give us what we need. Basic needs, discounts and opportunities to work and invest furthermore, pay out taxes. Ruto the 5th."
Ogunde Robert Benedict,There are no permanent friends nor permanent enemies in politics. Just the other day Mudavadi was against you. Now he is supporting you. Please tell us something new.p myapa
Were Hill,Don't expect anything in favour of wht you did. This is a world of interest and change is inevitable its human nature. You have to fight your way out now that you know their position.
Flora Mugai,Stop lamenting and move on that's what real people do . It won't change anything ama you are looking for sympathy vote? As you politicians say no permanent friends or enemy in politics.Tell Kenyans what you do for them leave Kenyans to decide.

George Gosho,"What is the big deal if ICC customers came together to make noise to avoid facing law? Chairman of lies, you were there to protect your dirty 'ginene' not just absolute love. You pocketed some lump-sum payment. You were bought. Stop shouting lest you provoke them to share the real hard stuff."
Joyce Mwareri,You fought for you to be in the government come-on mr opposition leader come August
Waithaka Ken,"When Uhuru was pleading with you to first work and deliver the promises you had to the people and wait for time to politick you didn't listen, instead you were chest thumping claiming nobody should tell you what to do and what not. So Cool down and relax."
Odiush Nyaburu,You can only state exactly what you came with in that marriage which you need uhuru Kenyatta to give you back so that you can go in peace without looking back

Kolesh Tumpes,"And we are still asking what happened to uhuruto bromance I think So is falling to the trap and he is exposing the reasons,  if he has been reminding the president that he would not have made it without him surely as a man and at  large a president I feel what he has been going through."
Aswani Fay,"We reminded u to always  RESPECT your boss, u ignored,, now its time to cry n also time for regrets"
Oyoo Philemon,And Raila stood with kibaki including campaigning for him for two months plus when he was on wheelchair but kibaki refuse to support him .just make noise there

Jacktone Ochieng,"Rao did more to Kibaki than you did to Uhuru. Rao campaigned for Kibaki and Wamalwa when they were in their sick bed and handed over the presidency to them on a silver plate.

James Yamo,Tell us something else standing by uhuru so that you can finish him does not make any senses

Am sorry it hurts when I have to switch off my TV to avoid listening to such insults. The president met his people in state house just like the Dp has been meeting his people in the Karen state house. The difference is the same and there's nothing wrong. Hazira nyingi si suluhu. The head of state should be given his due respect, regardless, just like he'll want to be given same respect tomorrow. The Head of state is a symbol of unity and our God given leader in his time and season. How do a parent feel when your child insults you.  The Dp should be cautious that he may be hurting more voters by day, especially in the central region and other parts of the country. Nobody wants a president with hazira nyingi and full of insults."

Gervas Abel,I think he has Uhuru's phone number. We are not interested in their personal stories
Nick Sirori,".. you stood by me, I agree! But why did you orchestrate an impeachment motion against me? Your thirst for power betrayed you. Don't blame your current political misfortunes on Raila Odinga or the handshake. Stop double speaking.... Oscar Sudi is going to be president before you.."

William Ouma,"Kumi yangu kumi yako was their personal and private affair. Hence, you cannot force the head of state to honor private promises for selfish gains. The president of any country is too important to be reduced to niunge mkono ju ulisema nitakula kumi pia. Put in another way, president Uhuru has the obligation to serve all the 50 million Kenyans as opposed to pleasing individuals."
Kenneth Abot,"You're not the first person to stand with a friend, we have been standing with friends in difficult situations more than you do but we expect nothing. You stood with Uhuru to cheat Kenyans, and when you realized that your lies were unable to sustain you together, you re-open new catastrophic bunch of lies in order to paint Uhuru as the master of lies and you terribly failed. Remember that your support to Uhuru was give and tae. He stood with you too to become DP. He gave you a half of his government to exercise and execute your nepotic appointment and tribal jongoism reign. Even RAO stood with Kibaki in 2022 but he has never lamented the way do. You're a professional liar pr excellent, you're war monger, you're a a hypocrite. The hottest part of the hell is reserved for people like you. (The hypocrites)"

Douglas Songore,"In 2002 When Kibaki got an accident in Machakos during campaigns, Raila called for an ambulance,  not trusting the driver of that ambulance, Raila himself drove Kibaki to hospital. He even paid for Kibakis plane's ticket to London for more medication and paid his  hospital bills. Back home Raila led the campaigns when Kibaki was on a wheelchair. Baadaye Kibaki did not vote for him. Ruto unatupigia kelele bure please!"
Richard Mwangi,How told you Kenyans are enemies? It is just competition. Look at this fool....so you burnt women and children in a church cz they were your enemies? That is how you reason? Those not following you are the enemy? You are physcotic.
Douglas Wamburu,"Please stop bragging because it is Uhuru who stood with you and brought you to Mt. Kenya through a handshake when nobody there wanted to hear your name following the atrocities that were committed to the Kikuyus in Eldoret during the 2007/8 PEV. It is that very handshake which allowed you to penetrate Mt. Kenya where now you can boast of a near fanatical following to the extent that recently you had the audacity to marshal your Mt. Kenya fanatical MPs to Ishaweri Uhuru‚Äôs home in Gatundu, where you took them to insult Uhuru‚Äôs mother under your watch. Out of your own selfish interests, you decided to become a stumbling block to a similar handshake between Raila and Uhuru Kenyatta because it is your game plan to ensure that Luos and Kikuyus remain divided yet know too well that this division between these two tribes has not only lasted for the last 50 years but has also been a catalyst for the tensions we witness in every five year election cycle. If you could only curb your selfish interests, work with both Raila and Uhuru in ensuring that the peace enjoyed today between the Kalenjins and the Kikuyus also takes place between the Kikuyus and the Luos, Kenya would become a haven of peace and the cycle of elections violence that the country experiences every 5 years would be a thing of the past."
