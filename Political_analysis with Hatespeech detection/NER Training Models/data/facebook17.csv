Stephen Mutisya,Democracy in ODM is at crossroads! Brave yourself for tough and rough times ahead!
Ebs Anarclate Omara,That's how  Kenyans felt every time you used to respond  about police brutality.You never listened to us.It is your time.
Steve Mbugua,Raila is a dictator and odm is a one man show so many politicians have suffered because of him lots of intimidations and frustrations is the nature under him...
Dismas Odhiambo,"You former police spokesperson,am praying that you should fail terribly in that race of governoship in Siaya.The way you used to defend police officers when they were killing innocent people before, during and after general election of 2013 and 2017, You...! You don't deserve any political set in any part of Nyanza province!"
Patrick Muthii,ODM is a family affair and the same old mzee pretends how he can rebelate this nation God forbid!!!
Kipchoge Sigei,Who told you paying for nominations guarantees you party primaries.  This is ODM ..D is silent buana..Raila being a  constant
Sammy Wafula,It's time you guys start shedding off odmaniac and survive with other parties that embrace competitive democracy!
Warui Kimaru Jr.,"Welcome to the world of politics Mr policeman, where betrayal is permanent"
Elijah Arap Koech,Democracy and ODM in one sentence is comical
Sylver,"Once you join ODM just be prepared for dictatorship, there is no democracy in ODM my friend"
Yegon Kipsang Peter,"ODM is a family party ,"
Nyamolo Dickence,"This is because of your hard eyed lies n denials on everything when you were the police spokesman.Police were killing, maiming, arresting and brutalizing Kenyans as you watched but maintained that there was no problem and that you were not aware  #OnyaliKabisa! Peleka hiyo mambo yenu ya Assmio-Oka-Odm mbali kabisa.Shenzi sana! Sisi tuko na Kiongozi bora anayefaa Kenya William Samoei Ruto na UDA.Kweraaaaa!"
Adiskin,"ODM continue to hold Nyanza people captives and denie them visionary and determined leaders line Charles Owino. Giving out direct tickets to Old, tired, cows and confidants who worship Raila and have poor track record give you an insight of how ODM is undemocratic !!"
Real Vince,Wewe nyoroshwa kabisaa. Mtu bladifakin sana. I remember this guy twisting police brutality. Those innocent people whose lives were cut short will sure hunt you.
Clinical Geff,"ODM has its puppets that are meant to shadow  democracy!!!!!!  Why ask you to drop ,,can't they see that you have a right  as a Kenyan!!!!!  Too bad you come from  such fixed areas!!!!!!!!!!!!"
Obadiah Nyakundi,You were the police spokesperson when baby pendo and others that the police killed innocently and when asked you used to defend even nonsense killers to prevent your job. The way you feel now is the way we felt at that time.
Wainaina Patrick,This is called negotiated democracy 👌. It's quite in order. I can't dream of ODM without SC James Orengo
Sparta Hommy Kenya,This guy called Charles Owino deserves no leadership seat in this country he doesn't have humanity in him.

Alex Mathei,"Those are the effects of the recent political party laws,,which odm and jubilee wanted to use inorder to humiliate members who may be feel shortchanged... UDA fellows warned you"
Kaniaru George,"Thank you Owino for realizing how the ODM is a sect owned, managed, and controlled by the ""chief priest"" and his second half as well as family. The song about democracy in it, is strange and the worst of its undoing is the followers who worship the ""high priest"" and his lieutenants, but the time has come for sound future minds like you and your big following to move away from that authoritarian sect."
Wan Eddie,Democracy must prevail.
Joshua Wauga,"Kindly please siaya people,vote for this team"

Ochieng Jah Asembo,If you want peace never compete with James Aggrey Orengo.James  Orengo has played a wonderful role in Raila's bid to Presidency. So James Orengo should have the opportunity and be given a first class priority  to vie and  lead the people of Siaya county. Period.
